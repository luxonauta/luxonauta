### 👋🏻 Hey, I'm Lucas!

But you might know me as **Luxa** or **Luxonauta**! 😅

I'm a front-end developer, designer and illustrator.

Focused on web development, experimenting with design details that feel like magic. ✨

### Work (Now)

- I'm building the best theme in the world - 🧛🏻‍♂️ [Dracula Theme](https://draculatheme.com) | [Dracula PRO](https://gumroad.com/a/320709843/tPfIDt)
- And helping build Koala to supercharge your outbound - 🐨 [Koala](https://getkoala.com)

### Projects

- [Luxa CSS](https://luxacss.com) - A minimalist CSS framework 🌱
- **Tickly** - a task manager that works (for everyone) 🤫
